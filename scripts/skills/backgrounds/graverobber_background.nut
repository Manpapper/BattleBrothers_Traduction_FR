So the story goes, anyway. | Once a fine jeweler, dementia drove %name% into crafting a very different style of attire. A toothy necklace chatters at you as he explains.} {The deviancies of such a man may know no bounds, but his for-now warm body could be of use. | He\'s not right in the head, but maybe he\'s right with a sword in hand. Maybe. | Disturbing as he might be, desperate times call for desperate recruits. | He wears a plain necklace with a subtle offwhite color best described as \'bone\'. | Driven away by an especially mad mob, %name% is one of many outcasts to venture into the world of mercenaries. | The man is quiet, but you can\'t shut him up around a graveyard. | Hopefully he likes putting cold bodies into graves as much as he likes digging them up.}";
