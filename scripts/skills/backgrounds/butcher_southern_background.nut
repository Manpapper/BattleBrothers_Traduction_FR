He sought something new. | After a human finger was found in one of his deer wrappings, the man was driven from his business. | Some say he most enjoyed butchering for the viziers\' men during one of their campaigns against the desert tribes and wishes to return to that experience once more. | Unfortunately, the war drove through his shop, leaving behind a number of carcasses he wouldn\'t dare butcher. | Butchering a tiny pig became a scandal when it turned out to be a nobleman\'s pet. He fled to save his own bacon.} {Something about blood and guts sits just right with %name%. In that case, welcome to the battlefield. | %name% looks at everything as a potential meat sale with breathing, moving packaging. | Many are disturbed by %name%\'s mere presence and all-too-wide eyes. | %name% is known to bite his tongue and savor the blood. | %name%\'s ears perk whenever a pig squeals. The same thing happens when a man screams. Interesting. | %name%\'s a butcher, but apparently has little interest in actually feeding the outfit.}";
