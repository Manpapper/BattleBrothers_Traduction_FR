Unfortunately for men, he found time to venture into the cities.} {For the past year he has been employed by a local lord, paraded around to fistfight the champions of royalty. | A lover of the bar brawl, the man has apparently been banned from too many taverns to count. | Gaining notoriety as a fighter in %randomtown% meant he had to fight every single proud, boasting, and drunk man who came his way. | Although he became an undefeated prizefighter, he was hardly earning enough to get by. | Fiery in spirit, he\'s always willing to take up fisticuffs. Local fighting rings say he\'s got a mean left hook.} {Hearing of greater fights to be had, %name% has put down his mitts to take up the more lucrative vocation of being a sellsword. | Only one person has bested %name%: his wife. After she chided him for being an embarrassment with no ambition, he decided to take up the more \'prestigious\' field of mercenary work. | Years of martial combat practically destroyed his memory. Some think he mistook a mercenary camp as an item on his shopping list. | Very low on crowns and barely able to open his broken hands to hug his own son much less throw a punch, %name% seeks a new career. | After years of hardship, the promise of regular pay for mercenary work is a tempting offer for him, even though he has little idea of actual warfare. | This man could murder a rock and injure a stone - a good addition to any outfit.}";
