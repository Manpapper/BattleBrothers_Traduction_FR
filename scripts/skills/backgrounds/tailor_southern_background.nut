So he says, anyway. | Once tasked with making a tunic embroidered with epic feats, %name% wondered what the outside world was really like. | Designing a dress adorned with {epic quests | epic feats}, %name% wondered if maybe he should be the one they wove stories about.} Now the tailor looks for a new life, no matter where it takes him. {Maybe he can dress the unit well, or something. | He\'s particular and peculiar, peppering everyone with clothing criticisms. | He\'s no natural soldier, but he appraises a man\'s attire as if he\'s about to go to war with it. | The way he measures and calculates for dressing, it\'s too bad %name% wasn\'t a siege engineer. | While hardly a soldier, %name%\'s earnest love for tailoring is to be admired. | %name%\'s knowledge of various cloths is seriously impressive. | A bit on the nimby-pimby side, %name% has the footwork of a swordfighter, but the swordfighting of a soft breeze. | %name% would seem very out of place in a suit of armor, but boy is he going to need one. | As it turns out, %name% can in fact make a silk purse out of a sow\'s ear. | Don\'t let his vocation fool you, %name% is more deft with his hands than some {cardsharks | jugglers | pickpockets}. | Tailors don\'t seem fit for combat, but then again neither do most of the men you run across these days. | A tailor seems ill-fit for combat, yet for some reason you find the finest soldiers in the strangest of places. | With an eye {for calculations | for measuring}, %name% is a lot smarter than he lets on at first glance.}";
