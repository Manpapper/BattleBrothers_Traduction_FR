He seeks redemption in the world of what he studied: war. | Using his position in academia to bed women, eventual scandals and controversies drove the historian from his field, and left him penniless and ready to take on any job. | Bored with reading about adventurers, the historian figured he\'d suit up to fashion himself a closer look at the real thing. | With so many mercenary bands floating around, the historian sought to attach himself for some real-life studying.} {%name% has little in common with actual soldiers, but his imaginative mind fancies a good battle nonetheless. | While %name% spent all his life writing, he spent exactly none of it fighting. Until now. | %name% has the itch to record your outfit\'s travels. He can help by grabbing a sword and suiting up. | A bag of books is hefted over %name%\'s shoulder. You suggest a flail as replacement. It\'s similar, but pointier and stabbier. | %name% is frequently found scribbling notes as he still sees the world with a researcher\'s eye. | %name% comes with a pocketful of quill pens. The feathers would make for some pretty good arrows. | You can place good faith in %name%\'s earnest want to research, but maybe not so much faith in his ability to swing a sword. | %name%\'s time with the outfit is to develop a theory, but can he survive the experiments? | You promise %name% that, shall he perish, you will find a way to record his life. He thanks you and hands over his will. It\'s written in a language foreign to you and you can read absolutely none of it. You smile back anyway.}";
