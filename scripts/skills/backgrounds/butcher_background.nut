He sought something new. | After a human finger was found in one of his deer wrappings, the man was driven from his business. | Some say he most enjoyed butchering for soldiers during the orc invasions and wishes to return to that experience once more. | Unfortunately, the war drove through his shop, leaving behind a number of carcasses he wouldn\'t dare butcher. | Living in a city under siege, he provided meat for the hungry. When it was found out where that meat came from, he was handed over to the besiegers who, unwittingly, let him live. | The man\'s friendliness with poachers caught up with him, ultimately leaving him on the road with a retinue of the local lords\'s men on his tail. | Butchering a tiny pig became a scandal when it turned out to be a nobleman\'s pet. He fled to save his own bacon.} {Something about blood and guts sits just right with %name%. In that case, welcome to the battlefield. | %name% looks at everything as a potential meat sale with breathing, moving packaging. | Many are disturbed by %name%\'s mere presence and all-too-wide eyes. | %name% is known to bite his tongue and savor the blood. | %name%\'s ears perk whenever a pig squeals. The same thing happens when a man screams. Interesting. | %name%\'s a butcher, but apparently has little interest in actually feeding the outfit.}";
