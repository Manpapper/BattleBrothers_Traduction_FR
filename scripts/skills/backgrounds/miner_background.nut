The tragedy pushed him from the field. | After his own son lost his life in the mines, the man left the job forever. | But suffering from relentless coughs, the man felt maybe a career in fresh air would better serve him.} {%name% has the stocky frame of a miner. Unfortunately, he has the lungs of one, too. | He\'s tough alright, but %name%\'s wheezing sounds like rusted blades grinding together.  | You have to wonder if %name%\'s lungs have enough metal dust in them to fashion a blade or two. | %name%\'s breath could probably ink a chunk of coal. | %name% spent years earning keep for a company store. Now he wants to earn some real coin. | %name% looks forward to pocketing some of that gold he spent years plucking out of the earth. | Annoyingly, %name% points at half your gear - the metal stuff, mostly - and reminds everyone who\'s responsible for it being there. | %name% has almost catlike vision in the dark. He would have made for a good assassin if it weren\'t for his damned wheezing. | %name% has cheated death a few times, so why not try it a few times more as mercenary? | %name%\'s already had the earth itself out for his head so a few things above the soil don\'t scare him much. | If darkness truly is death\'s ambassador, %name%\'s already been talking to it for years. | Stupidly brave souls like %name% can definitely find a good register in an outfit such as this. | %name% proudly boasts that, once upon a time, he could play cards in the dark. You don\'t doubt it. | If %name% can swing a sword as well as a pickaxe, then all is well.}";
