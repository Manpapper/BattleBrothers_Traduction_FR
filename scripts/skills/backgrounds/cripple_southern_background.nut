He explains that {he was once a mason, but that he was attacked by a madman for trying to replicate his work | he once donned armor as a knight, but that cruel fate has taken all of that from him | once upon a time he was a Vizier, but his poor vocabulary suggests this may be a lie | he was a peddler once, but the sale of a lobo-rail ended with him at the mercy of an angry town mob | he dabbled in cultism, but when he bailed they punished him for it | he used to brawl for decadent traders, but a beatdown by other fighters left him crippled | he used to fight in the arena, but a bad match ended with him horribly crippled | he used to rob graves, but when he got caught a parishioner broke more of his bones than he knew a skeleton even had | he dabbled in {the arcane arts | necromancy} but, made obvious by his near-deathly state, that experiment was shortlived | he was once a successful gambler, but as it turns out not paying back your debts is bad for business - and your bones | he used to catch rats for a living, but apparently a giant rat paid him a vengeful visit in the night | he once served a vizier of %randomcitystate%, but after dropping a plate of food he was sent to the dungeons where he was promptly forgotten for years | he once killed a man, sure, but that he deserved a better fate than the irreversible torture he received as punishment | he used to hunt witches, but a cruel mistress tricked him into drinking a concoction which crippled his very bones | he once deserted an army and, obviously, got caught | he used to juggle for the rich until he accidentally fell down some steps in the middle of a stunt. The steps proved rather edgy against his bones, it seems | he was born with a horrific deformity | his father brutally attacked him for not living up to his image | his mother scarred him with endless torture | his siblings tortured him all his life}. {The man looks so weak you can almost see his mortal coil flapping in the wind. | Hiring him would almost certainly be the man\'s doom. How merciful! | You don\'t want to be seen as hiring just anybody, but if this guy is a nobody, does that still count as \'anybody\'? | You\'ve seen dead people who look better than this man. | This guy is wolf-lunch on two legs. | The good news is that if he comes back from the dead he shouldn\'t be too hard to put down a second time. | Dreams and inanimate objects are more threatening than this poor git. | To be honest, you\'d rather hire a child, but apparently people look down on that so here we are instead. | And you thought %randombrother% smelled bad. | Hiring a man such as this would send anyone\'s moral compass spinning. | Oh c\'mon, look at him! Are the %companyname% really that in need of warm bodies? | Hiring this man just wouldn\'t be right. Whelp, here goes. | A pair of crutches has more value than this poor man. | This man is in such a sorry state he can play dead standing up.}";
