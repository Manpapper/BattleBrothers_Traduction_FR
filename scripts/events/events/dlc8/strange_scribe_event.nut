However, this has given me plenty insight into the inventive depths of the locals. There\'s something to be preened from such creativity, being that one\'s imagination draws surreptitiously from the sublime and real, and makes inferences on what it intuits yet knows not how to describe with scientific distinction. Even in the mire and fog of regional superstition and legerdemain I can make great advances.%SPEECH_OFF%Well, alright. You mention that you knew it was a fraud because the supposedly dead cretin was sweating.
