Their lieutenant steps forward, grinning.%SPEECH_ON%Oy\' mercenary, we\'ve little use for you in this world now.%SPEECH_OFF%Slowly, you lower your hand, hovering it above the pommel of your sword. You ask what the man means by that. He laughs.%SPEECH_ON%You haven\'t heard? War\'s over. The greenskins were routed from %randomtown% just a few days ago. Scouts report seeing them bastards running for the hills every which way, fighting amongst themselves, the orcs killing the goblins, goblins killing the orcs, just a full on rout. So, yeah, noble houses need not pay your sorry arse for nothing now because us real soldiers got it under control. Now why don\'t you and your pathetic lot clear out of the way.
