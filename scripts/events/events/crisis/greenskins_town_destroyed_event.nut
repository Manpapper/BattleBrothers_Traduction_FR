He states that the greenskins have annihilated the human armies around %city% and destroyed the town itself! | You come across a cartographer and a trader with an empty cart. They\'re redrawing a map and there\'s something curious about it: the mapmaker is erasing %city% from the paper.

Greenskins overran the defenses and killed everyone they got their hands on.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come across a trader on the path. His cart is emptied and missing some draught animals. There\'s blood on his face and clothes. You ask the man for his story. He straightens up.%SPEECH_ON%My story? No, it ain\'t my story. I was on my way to %city% only to find it overrun by greenskins. I barely escaped with my life. The town itself is done for. If that\'s the way you was headed, don\'t bother. It\'s gone. Completely gone.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
