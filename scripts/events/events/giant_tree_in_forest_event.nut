The roots go through the earth and into the realm of the gods. It is said they once listened, but now... we are not so sure.%SPEECH_OFF%You stare at the man, and his particularly withheld posture, and ask if he fears the tree. He smiles at you and shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%I respect it like a man would the sea, for the waters of the oceans hold many things to fear and, yet, the sailor sails anyway. Were the ocean a docile beast, would man refer to it so lovingly?%SPEECH_OFF%",
