Today, %hurtbro% walks right into it. | You set off a tripwire and hear the walls come alive with ancient machinery. Ducking, you think yourself in the clear only to turn around and see %hurtbro% has eaten the brunt of the trap\'s damage. Whoops... | You see a tripwire on the ground and laugh. So close, ancient trapmaker, so very close - suddenly, %hurtbro% walks right by you and triggers the trap. The idiot will live, but there is a lot of pain in his future. | %hurtbro%\'s whistling and the tune carries deep into the ruins, but the echo seems rather off, like it\'s hiccupping somewhere in the walls. You tell the men to hold their ground, but the whistler walks on ahead and promptly falls through the floor into a pit. Rushing to the edge, you see that he just managed to avoid some spikes. | While walking through the ruins, %hurtbro% sets off a trap which sends him plummeting through the floor. He lands on a lower floor dotted with holes. Spikes emerge, but slowly enough for the man to get out of the way. Thankfully, the trap didn\'t trigger in the right order and you manage to get the sellsword out of there. | While winding through the confusing ruins, %hurtbro% suddenly drops out of view. You rush to where he was to almost fall into the same trap: a pit in the ground littered with the crunchy molts of snakeskin. Thankfully, the critters are no longer around, but the fall itself was enough to put the hurt on the poor mercenary.}",

The nobleman jumps to his feet with unhinted energy.%SPEECH_ON%You have it! By the old gods! Lemme have it!%SPEECH_OFF%The artifact is handed over and %employer%\'s eyes widen. You inquire about your pay, but he\'s already in another world, as if he\'s been sucked into the artifact itself. One of his scribes steps forward out from the shadows of a corner. He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%Please excuse us, mercenary. My liege and I have duties to attend to.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is deep in a chair and perhaps even deeper in his thoughts. One of his guards has to tell him that you\'re there, repeating himself three times until the nobleman looks up. He stares at you, then at the artifact. His body rises from the chair as though it were animated by the impetuous of some unseen force. He takes the artifact and wheels around, rushing to his desk where he sets it down and squats before it, practically prostrating himself, observing it with atavistic fervor. The guard hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%You\'d best leave, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | A scribe of %employer%\'s welcomes you outside the nobleman\'s room. He\'s got moldy book breath and a hurriedness about his mannerisms.%SPEECH_ON%Is that the artifact? Is it?%SPEECH_OFF%You hand over a bag with the relic in it. The scribe\'s fingers clasp at the draw strings like beaks plucking at worms.%SPEECH_ON%Give it! Give! Here, take your money and go!%SPEECH_OFF%He slams a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns into your hands before ducking into %employer%\'s room. | A couple of scribes wait inside %employer%\'s room. The nobleman himself is asleep in his bed, head facing the ceiling, his arms at his side like some half-finished mannequin. One of the scribes steps forward.%SPEECH_ON%The relic, hand it over.%SPEECH_OFF%This is very off, but you sure as hell won\'t waken a sleeping lord. You inquire about pay. Another scribe throws you a sack of %reward_completion% crowns, the bag sliding across the stone floor.%SPEECH_ON%Now put the relic on the ground and leave.%SPEECH_OFF%You take your money and go. | You find %employer% humoring a crowd of nobility. Spying you over their heads, he hurries through his jokes before bidding adieu. He slides autour de room to greet you with whispers.%SPEECH_ON%Do you have the relic?%SPEECH_OFF%You hand it over and the man grins. He gives you a sack of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%Good job, sellsword, but you should go. This isn\'t your crowd. Not that it is mine, either.%SPEECH_OFF%He winks and shoos you off. | A scribe intercepts you outside %employer%\'s room. He puts a finger to his lips and shakes his head before guiding you further down the hall. Stepping before a brazier, the elder quickly glances around before pulling down on the torch.%SPEECH_ON%Push the wall, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You do as told. A slab of it isn\'t stone at all, but wood. It slides open and you step through. %employer% is there with a host of books and strange items littered about a dusky, candlelit room.

Finally, he puts it on the ground and calls out.%SPEECH_ON%Seems alright!%SPEECH_OFF%Suddenly, the real %employer% appears from the side of the room, cautiously stepping forward.%SPEECH_ON%Sorry for the theatrics, but there are powers here that you can\'t understand.%SPEECH_OFF%You doubt an artifact could come to life as a would-be assassin, but you won\'t question the nobleman\'s clearly insane thought processes.

I\'m not paying you to stand around and watch what I do.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and depart. As you leave, you hear the door open and a rush of womanly noises slip through in a quick rush before it closes again. | One of %employer%\'s guards takes you to the gardens where the nobleman is tending to his crops. He\'s teaching a young boy to clip tomatoes.%SPEECH_ON%The stem, you idiot! Clip this, see? Why would you ever stab the food? Never stab the food! Sellsword!%SPEECH_OFF%The lord bolts upright at the sight of you. He pushes the boy out of the way and comes over asking if you have the relic. You hand it over and receive %reward_completion% crowns in return. The nobleman nods.%SPEECH_ON%You\'ve done well, mercenary. I\'m losing faith in individuals\' abilities to do what I ask of them. I\'m sure you understand.%SPEECH_OFF%Over the nobleman\'s shoulders you see the boy assassinating another plant. You slowly nod. | You hand the relic over to %employer%. He stares at it with scrunched eyebrows, angrily rolling his fingers along his desk.%SPEECH_ON%Hmm, I guess that\'s it. A little disappointing, but an agreement is an agreement.%SPEECH_OFF%He begrudgingly slides a sack of %reward_completion% crowns over to you. | %employer% welcomes you into his room, offering you a goblet of wine. You drink as a scribe comes over and takes the relic. He goes to the side of the room and begins measuring, weighing, and even... tasting it? You ignore whatever calculations are going on there and inquire about your pay. %employer% grins.%SPEECH_ON%You\'re drinking it!%SPEECH_OFF%You pause with the goblet on your lips. The nobleman laughs.%SPEECH_ON%A joke, sellsword, relax! Here, %reward_completion% crowns as we agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | You open the door to %employer%\'s room to find the nobleman and a few scribes standing before a table. Oddly shaped vials and flasks are all over the place, some filled with even stranger colors. One of the scribes hurries over to you and shoots his hand out from overly big, loose sleeves, like snakes stabbing out of a cave. He steals the relic away with one hand while the other slams a sack of %reward_completion% crowns into your chest. %employer% waves you off.%SPEECH_ON%Leave, mercenary, you\'ve done as much as we have asked and that is as far as your services are required for now.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
