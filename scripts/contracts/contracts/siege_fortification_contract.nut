You will be paid %reward% crowns for your work.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% meets you and takes you to his garden. Given the state of things, he seems oddly at ease. He grazes a vine of tomatoes and begins to talk.%SPEECH_ON%War is a hell of a thing. Men are dying as we speak because I spoke a few words. Just like that. I don\'t want to misuse my power.%SPEECH_OFF%You jack your thumbs into your beltline and respond.%SPEECH_ON%For the sake of my men, I hope you do not.%SPEECH_OFF%%employer% nods and grabs a tomato. The vine goes taut before snapping free. He takes a bite then nods again, as though the life of a gardener is the one he\'d prefer.%SPEECH_ON%I have a commander by the name of %commander% currently sieging %objective%. He is finalizing plans to start an assault. I\'m sure that word scares you, but he has been working on this plan for some time. He just needs the last bit of men to make sure it fires off without issue. Go to him, help him, and I will pay you %reward% crowns.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% greets you and brings you to one of his battle maps.

Go there, help him, and I will pay you %reward% crowns. Sounds good, no?%SPEECH_OFF% | When you enter %employer%\'s room you find a bevy of commanders standing around a map. Little tokens representing nobility pepper the paper. One man uses a stick to push a wooden horse across some poorly drawn plains. %employer% welcomes you, but one of his generals takes you to a side and explains what they need: \n\n Commander %commander% is currently in %objective% conducting a siege. The defenders are about to break, but he\'s worried that relief is on its way. He wants to launch the final assault before aid can come to the defenders. Go there, help the commander with whatever he needs, and you will be paid %reward% crowns. | You stop outside %employer%\'s door and ask yourself, Do you need this shit in your life? Suddenly, a servant bumps into you with a chest of crowns. He asks if %employer% is inside because the %reward% crowns are ready for delivery to the sellsword. You quickly butt ahead of the servant and enter the room. %employer% welcomes you warmly. He explains that commander %commander% is currently sieging %objective% and is about to have a breakthrough. He just needs a few more men to push things over the edge. %employer% pretends to think and then finally adds.%SPEECH_ON%%reward% crowns will be in it for you.%SPEECH_OFF%You feign surprise at this amount. | You\'re not sure if the war is going well for %employer%, or if all his generals always appear this stressed during times like these. They look like they\'d rather fall on their swords than spend another second staring at a battle map. %employer% is sitting in the corner of the room next to a fire and a servant holding a pitcher of wine. The nobleman waves you over and begins to talk.%SPEECH_ON%Don\'t mind the grumps. The war is fine. Everything is fine. Just to show you how fine it is, I need you to go talk to commander %commander% at %objective% because his siege of that damned fortification is about to come to an end. Victory is at hand and all you have to do is help me take it! How do %reward% crowns sound?%SPEECH_OFF% | You enter %employer%\'s room to find the nobleman slunk down in a comfy looking chair. There are two large dogs napping at his feet and a purring cat in his lap. He is completely clonked out, snoring loudly with a dripping goblet somehow still wrenched in an outstretched arm. A man adorned in a general\'s attire beckons you across the room.%SPEECH_ON%Don\'t mind the lord. The war has weighed heavy on his mind. Now, listen. I\'ve got my orders, and I\'ve got yours. We need you to go to %objective% and help commander %commander% in sieging the fortifications there. That is all.%SPEECH_OFF%You inquire about pay. The general\'s face sours.%SPEECH_ON%Yes. Pay. Of course. I was to promise you %reward% crowns. I hope it is sufficient for your... honorable services.%SPEECH_OFF%Those final words seem to pain the man. It is clear he\'s been instructed to be as diplomatic as possible. | One of %employer%\'s generals meets you outside in the hall.%SPEECH_ON%The lordship is busy.%SPEECH_OFF%He plants a scroll in your chest. You unfurl it and read. Per the writing, one commander %commander% is currently sieging %objective% and needs help. No doubt this is where the %companyname% is supposed to come in. You look up at the man. He grumbles and speaks through gritted teeth.%SPEECH_ON%Your pay is to be %reward% crowns, your honorable sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%Those last words seem coached. | You find %employer% and he takes you out to his personal kennels. He throws scraps to the dogs as he walks and talks.%SPEECH_ON%The war is going great. It is simply the greatest event I\'ve ever undertaken and I\'m in utter bliss about the whole affair.%SPEECH_OFF%He pets one of the mutts behind the ear before letting the dog lick his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%But not all is what it could be. I need you to go to %objective% to aid commander %commander% who is leading the siege there. %reward% crowns will be paid for your help.%SPEECH_OFF%A servant runs over with a live chicken. The nobleman takes it by the legs and heaves it into a cage of barking dogs. The poultry flaps madly, bouncing along a sea of jawing canines before suddenly getting snatched down. It\'s torn to shreds in mere moments. %employer% turns to you, brushing a feather off your shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%So, do we have a deal?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room which has, it appears, been flipped into an adhoc war room. Commanders stand dutifully over a battle map, pushing military tokens back and forth and arguing about the results of the simulacrums. %employer% brings you to a side. He turns the rings on his fingers as he talks.%SPEECH_ON%Commander %commander% needs help sieging %objective%.

They slam a wormy cow\'s head into the bucket and slacken the rope spring until the pole of the war machine shoots forward, launching a spinning, bleeding black head toward the fortifications.

Given these facts, he is preparing a final assault and simply needs the men of the %companyname% to be ready when the time comes. | The siege at %objective% looks more like the recreation in a large play than the efforts of a concentrated war effort. Both sides are in a state of miserable inadequacy, hurling insults back and forth over the walls, and in between quietly cursing the fact they had the poor luck to be stuck in this hellish situation. %commander%, though, comes to you with a cheery spark in his eyes.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, mercenaries. Let me fill you in on what is going on. We have cut off the food supplies to %objective% and a few nights ago one of our agents managed to burn their granary to the ground. They are hungry and soon they will be dying. Because we are so pressed for time, I\'m organizing an all-out assault to bring this siege to a quick end. Just be ready when the time comes.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to %objective% to see the fortifications standing silhouetted against the horizon and %commander% staring through a pair of leather-wrapped ocular lenses, grimacing angrily at what he\'s glassing. He hands you the device and you take a look.\n\n The first thing you see is a man\'s ass bobbing up and down as he pats it with both hands.

Rows of tents are filled with tired and grumbly men. They cook stews out of pots that have never been cleaned, and exchange jokes that were never clean to begin with.

I will be assaulting the fortifications soon and when I do, I need you and your men at the ready.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to %commander%\'s siege camp to find soldiers loading a net of heads into a catapult and launching it over %objective%\'s fortifications.

Corpses come burnt, beheaded, missing limbs, trailing viscera as they\'re dragged, and a select few looked as though they\'d simply died in their sleep. One of the professional soldiers leans out from a tower\'s crenelations, tears down the fort\'s banner, and hoists the %noblefamily% sigil in its place to much cheering. | Dead bodies litter the courtyard and they\'re folded over the walls like wet clothes and some are in the corners with looks of shock on their faces and you see some blackened shapes wiry and crooked in the ruins of a burnt stable and amongst these dead men are horses and pigs and dogs and even fray feathered birds that all managed to get sucked into the violence which visited this place with unstoppable inertia.\n\n %commander% is going about his surviving men to congratulate them on a job well done.
